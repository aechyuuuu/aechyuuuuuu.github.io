<h1>Want So Bad</h1>
<h2>Chorus and Post-Chorus</h2>
<p><pre>Pink chroma key background, the surrounding scenes
Love is so intuitive everything changes
The start of a typical romance, though I know it all, I deeply
Fall into you and get my hopes up again, ah-ah, ah-ah

Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
I've seen it all before but I keep freezing up
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
I'm not used to it, I know it's pain, but I really want it so bad
