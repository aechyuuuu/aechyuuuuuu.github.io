<h1>Want So Bad</h1>
<h2>Verse 3</h2>
<p><pre>Let's get it started, getting anxious, can't think straight
I'll give you an armful of cosmos flowers
Love you, I wanna place myself in a spot next to you
I'll hug you, don't know if it was the wind
Or the feeling of affection that stirred the air, it goes high above the sky into the universe
I'll hold you tight and say I've always been waiting for this moment
If I hold it any longer, I might just blow up
Pink chroma key background, the surrounding scenes
</p>
