<h1 id="want">Want So Bad Verse 2</h1>
<p class="sobad"><pre>Without a trailer, the unfolding drama
Replay over and over, highlight
Up and down, it’s a breathtaking roller coaster
Ride, come closer just the two of us
Together we make one whole romantic comedy movie
Push and pull, one mistake and it’s all over oh
Look ahead and behind, approach carefully
Get closer, I'm not just playing around</p>
