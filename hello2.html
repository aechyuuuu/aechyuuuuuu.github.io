<h1>Want So Bad Pre-Chorus to Post-Chorus</h1>
<p><pre>It's a pretty big issue, why, in my head
So many thoughts keep me awake every night
With you everyday, sugar ride, flower beds everywhere my heart
Spring snuck into my heart and left me frozen with excitement

Pink chroma key background, the surrounding scenes
Love is so intuitive everything changes
The start of a typical romance, though I know it all, I deeply
Fall into you and gеt my hopes up again, ah-ah, ah-ah

Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
I've seen it all beforе but I keep freezing up
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
I'm not used to it, I know it's pain, but I really want it so bad</p>
