<p id="reflect">

	In this quarter, I learned more about CSS. With CSS, styling webpages will be easier. It also makes our codes more organized. I also learned that just like us, webpages also have different layers. There is one for its behaviour, one for its styles, and another one for the whole structure.
<br><br>
	I also learned more that I need to focus more on ICT. I realized that I started to weaken in ICT, but I didn't do anything with it. I learned that when I start to have problems in lessons, especially in ICT, I should ask others or my teacher for clarifications in the topics.If that doesn't work, then I should study harder, and try practicing more in coding or any other activities. I can use these lessons that I have learned this quarter to improve better not only in ICT, but to be a better student.
